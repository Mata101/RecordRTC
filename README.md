# RecordRTC CHECKING
```
This repo contains the code that I managed to build based on Jasper's Sandbox that he shared to me.

Pros and Cons based on what I observed with Jasper's output

Pros:
It can record a screen video, video through webcam, and audio.
Cons:
It doesn't have an option to trim or loop both video and audio.
